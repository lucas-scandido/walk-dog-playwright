## Test Execution Scripts
```
yarn test:run                          # Run all tests in headless mode.
yarn test:open                         # Run all tests in interactive mode.
yarn test:debug                        # Debug a test file step by step.
yarn test:generate                     # Test generator: Playwright will generate the code for the user interactions.
```

To run or debug just one test file, insert the spec path in front of the command: 

- **Headless mode:**
```
yarn test:run tests/signup
```

- **UI mode:**
```
yarn test:open tests/signup
```

- **Debug mode:**
```
yarn test:debug tests/signup
```
